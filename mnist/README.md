# Predicting digits using MNIST Dataset

I'm using my knowledge of TensorFlow to create a basic model of neural network from scratch.
This notebook uses one of the sample dataset in TensorFlow libraries, MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

I've got 95.14% accuracy on this by using basic model using 3 hidden layers, softmax_crossentropy loss function and AdamOptimizer.
